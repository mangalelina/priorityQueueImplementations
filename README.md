# priorityQueueImplementations

This is my own implementations of priority queues through three different approaches. 

Sorted Vector: this is the easiest implementation of a priority queue. It is built upon a sorted vector of values. It has undesirable runtimes but it is the easiest of the three to understand the concept behind priority queues. 

Binary Heap: this is a mix/max heap implementation based on a binary tree. This is good for practicing the use of a vector to represent a tree as well as related functions such as fixUp, fixDown, and Heapify. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap)

Pairing Heap: this heap implementation is founded on using nodes such that each node has an additional pointer to their parent. A key function of this implementation is the meld function that merges two heaps into one. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_heap) 

Using any material from here is against the University of Michigan honor code.
